BACKGROUND

• Web app to run locally
• App for translating Tibetan into English
• There is a Source string which is then translated into Target string
• There are usually many of these pairs of strings
• Translator goes through the strings, translating them one by one
• Translator spends all day long in the app
• We want to give as good of "translator experience" (TX) as possible
• We want to consider subtle points and finer details
