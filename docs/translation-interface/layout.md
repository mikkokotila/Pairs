# Translation Interface Layout

This page provides a detailed overview of the layout and visual organization of the translation interface in Pairs. Understanding the layout will help you navigate the interface efficiently and make the most of its features.

![Translation Interface Overview](../images/translation-interface-overview.png)

## Main Layout Components

The translation interface in Pairs is organized into several key areas, each serving a specific purpose in the translation workflow:

1. **Top Navigation Bar** - Contains controls for file management, mode selection, and global actions
2. **Source Text Column** - Displays the original Tibetan text
3. **Target Text Column** - Displays and allows editing of the translation
4. **Context Pane** - Provides contextual information and tools
5. **Status Bar** - Shows status information and additional controls

These components are arranged in a responsive layout that can be customized to suit your preferences.

## Top Navigation Bar

The top navigation bar spans the entire width of the interface and contains:

- **File Selection Dropdown** - Located at the far left, allows you to select and switch between translation files
- **Mode Selection Buttons** - Centered in the navigation bar, these toggle buttons switch between Translation Mode, Review Mode, and Reader View
- **Action Buttons** - Located at the right side, these buttons provide access to common actions:
  - Save button
  - Settings button
  - Help button
  - User profile button

The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the screen, ensuring these controls are always accessible.

## Source Text Column

The source text column is typically positioned on the left side of the interface and displays:

- **Column Header** - Shows "Source Text" and contains controls for text size and display options
- **Line Numbers** - Displayed along the left edge of the column
- **Source Text Segments** - The original Tibetan text, divided into logical segments
- **Segment Status Indicators** - Visual indicators showing the status of each segment (untranslated, in progress, completed, reviewed)
- **Current Segment Highlight** - Visual highlighting of the currently selected segment

The source column width can be adjusted using the resize handle between the source and target columns.

## Target Text Column

The target text column is typically positioned in the center of the interface and contains:

- **Column Header** - Shows "Translation" and contains controls for text formatting and editing options
- **Line Numbers** - Corresponding to the source text line numbers
- **Translation Segments** - The translated text, aligned with the source segments
- **Active Editing Area** - The currently editable segment, with rich text editing capabilities
- **Formatting Toolbar** - Appears when editing a segment, providing text formatting options
- **Translation Suggestions** - AI-generated suggestions may appear below the editing area

Like the source column, the target column width can be adjusted using resize handles.

## Context Pane

The context pane is positioned on the right side of the interface and provides:

- **Context Tabs** - Tabs at the top of the pane for switching between different types of context:
  - Dictionary
  - Notes
  - History
  - References
  - AI Assistant
- **Context Content Area** - Displays the content for the selected tab
- **Context Controls** - Buttons and controls specific to each context type
- **Resize Handle** - Located at the left edge of the pane, allows adjusting the width
- **Collapse Button** - Allows minimizing the context pane to provide more space for the translation columns

The context pane can be collapsed to provide more space for the translation columns when needed.

## Status Bar

The status bar runs along the bottom of the interface and displays:

- **Progress Indicators** - Shows overall translation progress (percentage complete, segments translated)
- **Current Position** - Displays the current segment/line number
- **Word Count** - Shows word count statistics for the current file
- **Sync Status** - Indicates whether changes are saved and synchronized
- **Mode Indicator** - Shows the current working mode (Translation, Review, Reader)

The status bar provides at-a-glance information about your current work status.

## Responsive Design

The Pairs interface is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and configurations:

- **Column Resizing** - Drag the dividers between columns to adjust their relative widths
- **Pane Collapsing** - The context pane can be collapsed to provide more space for translation
- **Full-Screen Mode** - The interface can expand to use the entire screen
- **Zoom Controls** - Text size can be adjusted independently in each column

On smaller screens, the interface automatically adjusts to maintain usability while prioritizing essential components.

## Layout Customization

You can customize the layout to suit your preferences:

- **Column Arrangement** - Change the order of columns (Settings → Interface → Column Order)
- **Default Widths** - Set preferred default widths for each column (Settings → Interface → Column Widths)

- **Color Scheme** - Select from light, dark, or custom color schemes (Settings → Appearance)
- **Font Settings** - Adjust font family, size, and line spacing (Settings → Appearance → Fonts)

Your layout preferences are saved and will be applied each time you open Pairs.
