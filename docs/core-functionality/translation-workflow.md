# Translation Workflow

This guide outlines the end-to-end translation workflow in Pairs, from importing a new text to publishing the final translation.

## Overview of the Translation Process

The translation process in Pairs typically follows these stages:

1. **Preparation**: Import or create a new text for translation
2. **Initial Translation**: Create the first draft of the translation
3. **Review and Refinement**: Review and improve the translation
4. **Finalization**: Finalize the translation and prepare it for publication
5. **Publication**: Export the translation in the desired format

Each stage has specific tools and features in Pairs to support your work.

## Stage 1: Preparation

Before you begin translating, you need to prepare your text:
