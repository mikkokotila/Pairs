- **Translation Mode**: For creating and editing translations
- **Review Mode**: For reviewing and refining translations
- **Reader View**: For reading the completed translation

### Translation Workflow

The typical translation workflow in Pairs consists of:

1. **Creating or importing** a new text
2. **Translating** the text segment by segment
3. **Reviewing** the translation for accuracy and consistency
4. **Refining** the translation based on feedback
5. **Publishing** the final translation
