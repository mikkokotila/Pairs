# File Management

Effective file management is essential for organizing your translation projects in Pairs. This guide covers how to create, open, save, and manage translation files.

## Translation File Structure

Pairs uses a structured file format to store translations:

- Translation files are stored in your workspace directory
- Each file contains both the source Tibetan text and the target translation
- Files are organized by project and can be categorized for easy access
- Metadata about the translation is stored within the file

## Creating a New Translation File

To create a new translation file:

1. Click the **New** button in the top navigation bar
2. In the dialog that appears, enter:
   - **File Name**: A name for your translation file
   - **Source Text**: The Tibetan text to be translated (you can paste text or upload a file)
   - **Project**: Optionally, select or create a project to organize your files
3. Click **Create** to create the new file

You can also:

- Use the search function to find specific files

The commit history is maintained, allowing you to track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
